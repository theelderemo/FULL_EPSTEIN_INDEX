# FULL_EPSTEIN_INDEX

# CONTENT WARNING: This repository contains graphic and highly sensitive material regarding sexual abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence. It also contains unverified allegations and raw witness statements. User discretion is strongly advised.

## Overview

Note. There is ALOT of data. OCR made mistakes scanning the files. So that being said, there is a lot of noise in the dataset, whether it be from OCR taking words out of normal 'pictures' from the pdf's, or character recognition failure. Feel free to contribute, clean up, add too, etc. 

View the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/theelderemo/FULL_EPSTEIN_INDEX)  

View ALL raw files [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18tIY9QEGUZe0q_AFAxoPnnVBCWbqHm2p?usp=drive_link) This includes all releases, from all government bodies, from all timelines.

This is a comprehensive, unified research archive aggregating public releases related to the Jeffrey Epstein estate and associated investigations.

This repository expands upon earlier archives (such as the initial November 2025 House Oversight release) by integrating the First Phase of Declassified Epstein Files released by the Department of Justice. Unlike previous datasets restricted to scanned emails, this index combines:

House Oversight Documents: ~20,000 pages of emails and estate records (Nov 2025).
DOJ Disclosures: Flight logs, contact books (redacted), and the "Masseuse List."
Multimedia Evidence: BOP video footage and audio recordings from the Maxwell Proffer sessions.
FBI releases, Customs and Border Patrol releases, etc.
Note on Updates: This index is a living archive. As additional phases of files are declassified and released by government bodies, they will be processed, indexed, and added to this repository.

The repository is organized to facilitate open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis and research.

Always cross-reference with the original raw files.
